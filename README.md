# WeatherApp

Live: https://francisgolden.github.io/WeatherApp/

This simple web app lets you search for the weather of any given city. I used the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve the meteorological data.

During the making of this project I learned about:
- Fetch API
- Promises
- Async/await functions
